# OCD Patient Dataset: SQL Project and Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

The "OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data" SQL Project and Power BI Dashboard present a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information on 1500 individuals diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The project aims to provide valuable insights into the demographic and clinical profiles of these individuals through SQL queries and a visually appealing Power BI dashboard.

## SQL Project

### Dataset Description

The dataset includes key demographic details (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, education level), clinical information (date of OCD diagnosis, duration of symptoms, previous psychiatric diagnoses), and details about OCD symptoms, severity, and co-occurring mental health conditions.

### SQL Queries

The SQL project involves a series of queries applied to the dataset to extract meaningful information, analyze patterns, and derive insights. These queries cover aspects such as demographic distribution, symptom severity, medication prescriptions, and the presence of family history.

### Getting Started

```sql
-- Database Setup
-- Import the dataset into your preferred SQL database.
